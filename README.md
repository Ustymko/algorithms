An image is represented by an m x n char grid image where image[i][j] represents the first letter of collor name on the image.

You are also given two integers (coordinates of the starting point, f.e. sr, sc), and char - color. You should perform a flood fill on the image starting from the pixel image[sr][sc].

To perform a flood fill, consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with color.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.
